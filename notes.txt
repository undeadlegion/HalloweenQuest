ISSUES AND QUESTIONS
1. Battle scene create runs multiple times - sometimes - why???
2. Soundtrack is added (layered on top) each time you return to the overworld
3. What to do if player clicks attack again before last attack is over
4. Do all Magic buttons show up or only the ones that are available?
5. Menus from overworld - right now we only have stats but it should include magic and equipment
6. If you do a magic spell in battle, does it count as a turn and does the enemy attack?
7. Need details of how each magic spell works (formulas)


ECECEC - attack screen hex code
