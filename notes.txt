TO DO
1. Battle pacing and feedback
2. Loop main music when it finishes (do we have the smaller file yet?)
3. Visual feedback when an enemy is defeated
4. Magic - Fireball function
5. Magic - Buff function
6. Adjust run function to use speed and 50% chance of running if slower
 
 
ISSUES AND QUESTIONS
3. What to do if player clicks attack again before last attack is over
4. Do all Magic buttons show up or only the ones that are available?
5. Menus from overworld - right now we only have stats but it should include magic and equipment
6. If you do a magic spell in battle, does it count as a turn and does the enemy attack?
7. Need details of how each magic spell works (formulas)
